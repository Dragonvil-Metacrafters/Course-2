Leson 2:
Smart contracts are called programs in Solana
A transaction is either successful or not.
  In contact this probably means that something like a vesting contract has 2 transactions at least, 1 to try and establish it. and 1 to interact with an established contract.

Is it a spoiler that we are going to need `sendAndConfirmRawTransaction` cause we got an unused import hehe





Note to self remember:
yarn init -y
yarn add @solana/web3.js
"scripts": {
  "start": "node index.js"
},
